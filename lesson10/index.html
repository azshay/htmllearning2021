        <h1>Antoine de Saint Exupéry - The little prince</h1>
        <h3>TO LEON WERTH</h3>
        <p>
            I ask the indulgence of the children who may read this book for dedicating it to a grown-up. I have a
            serious
            reason: he is the best friend I have in the world. I have another reason: this grown-up understands
            everything, even books about children. I have a third reason: he lives in France where he is hungry and
            cold. He needs cheering up. If all these reasons are not enough, I will dedicate the book to the child from
            whom this grown-up grew. All grown-ups were once children - although few of them remember it. And so I
            correct my dedication: <br><br> <span>To LEON WERTH WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE BOY</span>

            Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called True Stories from Nature, about
            the primeval forest. It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is a
            copy of the drawing.
